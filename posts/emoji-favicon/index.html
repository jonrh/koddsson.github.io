      <p>So I was working on <code><a href="https://jsonresume.io">jsonresume.io</a></code> this weekend and really wanted a favicon for the page. I don't know about you but I kind of dislike having to add a favicon. I don't really know how to make a icon and so I keep reaching more and more into the ever expanding unicode emoji sets</P>
      <p>I really wanted just to drop a üìù into a <code>&#x3C;link /&#x3E;</code> tag and call it a day. As far as I knew this wasn't possible, prompting this tweet: </p>

      <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Which technical committee do I need to submit a proposal to in order to get emojis as favicons?  <a href="https://twitter.com/WHATWG?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@WHATWG</a> ?</p>&mdash; Kristj√°n is not getting into the sandwich debate.

      <p>To make a long story short, I made my way to <code><a href="https://whatwg.org/">whatwg.org</a></code> to figure out how to make a proposal. That lead me to this issue <code><a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/661">#661</a></code>. That mentions that you can set the favicon dynamically with a data uri.</p>

      <p>Turns out I don't need to do a proposal at all! Even thought it's not as easy as <code>&#x3C;link rel="icon" value="üçï" /&#x3E;</code> it's still pretty straightforward if you can write some JavaScript. Here's the code I wrote to set the favicon of this post: </p>

      <p>
        <pre>
const canvas = document.createElement('canvas')
canvas.height = 64
canvas.width = 64

const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d')
ctx.font = '64px serif'
ctx.fillText('üõ∞', 0, 64)
console.log(canvas.toDataURL())

const favicon = document.querySelector('link[rel=icon]')
favicon.href = canvas.toDataURL()</pre> 
      </p>

      <p>You could even wrap this in a function and dynamically set the favicon.</p>
